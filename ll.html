<p className="mb-4">M. <strong>Liability for Service Interruptions</strong>. From time to time, due to maintenance,
    malfunctions or failures of software, equipment, or telecommunications devices, as well as unusual transaction
    volume or similar reasons, access to your Account or Card may not be available to you. Access to your Account may
    also be interrupted as a result of things beyond our reasonable control, computer failures, loss of power, failure
    or interruption of communication or transportation facilities, riots, strikes, or civil unrest. You agree that we
    shall not be responsible for any loss, damages, costs or expenses that you may suffer or incur, directly or
    indirectly, as a result of the unavailability of access to your Account or Card, regardless of whether it could be
    shown that we could have prevented or reduced the duration of such unavailability by taking any action within our
    reasonable control. We shall also not be responsible for any loss, damages, costs or expenses which you may suffer
    or incur, directly or indirectly, as a result of your inability to access your Account or Card caused directly or
    indirectly, in whole or in part, by your computer or mobile device, your inability to establish a connection to or
    to access the Internet, or other limitations or constraints of the Internet. The provisions set forth in this
    section shall apply in addition to any other provisions in this Agreement but as applied to service interruptions
    for access to your Account, this section shall control.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">N. <strong>Section Headings and Successors</strong>. The headings in this Agreement are only for
    convenience and do not in any way limit or define your or our rights or obligations under this Agreement. This
    Agreement will be binding on your personal representatives, executors, administrators, and successors.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">O. <strong>Change of Address or any Application Information</strong>. You must notify us through the
    Service Provider Platform of any change of address, email address or phone number or any material change to
    information you provided us in your application to open an Account. Any notice we provide to you will be binding and
    sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address
    change notice from the U.S. Postal Service or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us
    that the address in our records no longer matches your address.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">P. <strong>Communications</strong>. You acknowledge that data, including emails, may be accessed by
    unauthorized third parties when communicated between you and the Bank, using the Internet, telephone, or other
    electronic devices. We are not responsible for any misdirected data or disclosures that occur as a result of your
    use of third-party electronic communication channels.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">Q. <strong>Calls and Messages</strong>. You agree that we or our agents or service providers may
    contact you regarding any matter for any non- telemarketing reason using any kind of telecommunications technology
    at any email and telephone number you provide to us, including the phone number for your mobile device. You agree to
    receive these calls and messages, including pre-recorded or auto-dialed calls. You also agree that we may send text
    messages to any phone number for your mobile device you provide to us. You understand and accept that your service
    provider may charge you for these calls and messages consistent with applicable law. For quality control purposes
    and for other reasons, you permit us to record and monitor your telephone conversations and electronic
    communications with us (including email). Unless the law requires otherwise, you consent in advance to such
    recording and monitoring and we do not need to remind you of these activities at the time of the call or
    communication. To revoke the consent provided pursuant to this subsection, you must send ten (10) days’ prior
    written notice of such revocation to 2955 Campus Drive #110, San Mateo, CA 94403.
</p>
<ul classname="mb-4">
    <li>Compliance with Laws and Rules. You acknowledge that any payment order, payment instruction, or transfer requests
        under this Agreement may not be used in violation of the laws of any state or jurisdiction, the United States or any
        other country, including without limitation laws administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. You agree to
        comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, including Protected Information and
        Operating Circulars and with (i) all applicable rules and operating guidelines issued by the National Automated
        Clearing House Association or other clearing agent and (ii) any policies and procedures, including any guide,
        guidelines and related procedures provided to you from time to time by us (collectively, the “Rules”). You will be
        responsible for knowing the requirements of the applicable Rules, and you will have the responsibility to fulfill
        any compliance requirement or obligation that we and/or you may have under the Rules applicable to this Agreement
        and of the services provided to you hereunder, including without limitation sanction laws administered by the Office
        of Foreign Assets Control, and other requirements relating to anti‐money laundering, including but not limited to
        the federal Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and any regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department to implement
        such Acts, as amended from time to time. Each time you make a transfer request or transaction, you represent to us
        that each such request or transaction is bona fide and/or you conduct your business and originate payments,
        transactions and/or other related activity in compliance with the applicable laws and Rules. You shall be liable for
        the amount of any fines and/or liabilities assessed against us for any violation of the Rules that are due to the
        acts or omissions of you or any other third party providing services to you that in any way relate to the service
        under this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li>Bankruptcy or Insolvency. You will immediately notify us of any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or similar
        action initiated by or against you or any of you principals and will include us on the list of creditors as filed
        with the Bankruptcy Court and failure to do so will be cause for immediate termination or any other action available
        to us under applicable Laws or Rules. As an executory contract to make a loan, or extend other debt financing or
        financial accommodations to or for the benefit of you, this Agreement cannot be assumed or assigned under your
        bankruptcy.
    </li>
    <li>Survival. Termination of this Agreement shall not impact any right or obligation arising prior to termination, and
        in any event, the parties agree that any right or obligation which, by its nature, should survive termination of
        this Agreement will survive any such termination (including, but not limited to Sections IV (Arbitration and
        Waivers) and V (Miscellaneous Terms) of this Agreement).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 className="mb-4">VI. TAX REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING.
</h3>
<p className="mb-4">If you are subject to backup withholding, you may not access or use the Account. Internal Revenue
    Code requires most recipients of dividends, interest, or other payments to give Taxpayer Identification Numbers to
    payors who must report payments to the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service uses the numbers for
    identification purposes and to verify the accuracy of your tax return.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">If you fail to furnish a correct Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), you may be subject to a
    penalty of $50 for each such failure unless such failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. If
    you fail to furnish a TIN, the Bank may refuse to open your Account. The Bank may close an Account which was opened
    without a TIN and you fail to subsequently provide a TIN.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no imposition of backup
    withholding, you may be subject to a penalty of $500. Willfully falsifying certifications or affirmations may
    subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment. If you disclose or use a TIN in violation of
    federal law, you may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.
</p>
<h3 className="mb-4">VII. WIRE TRANSFERS.
</h3>
<li>General. In the event we make available to you wire transfers of funds from your Account(s) with us for credit to an
    account at another financial institution or another account with us (“Wire Transfer”), whether such transfers are
    domestic or international, this Section VII applies, in addition to the other terms and conditions set forth in this
    Agreement.. We will make available to you, from time to time, our policies, procedures, guidelines and other
    writings governing the use of the Wire Transfer Services by you, as may be amended or supplemented by Bank from time
    to time (the “Wire User Guide”). You will comply with and preform all of your obligations under this Agreement in
    compliance with the Wire User Guide and this Agreement. If there is a conflict between the Wire User Guide and this
    Agreement, the Wire User Guide shall control. If made available to you, you may send a Wire Transfer by submitting a
    request through the Service Provider Platform. When acting upon your Wire Transfer instructions, we may use any
    means of transmission, funds transfer system, clearing house, or intermediary bank that we reasonably select. We may
    make use of correspondents, agents, subagents, and funds transfer and communication systems. Such third parties
    shall be deemed your agents, and we shall not be liable for any errors, delay, mis-delivery, or failure of delivery
    by any of them unless applicable law says otherwise. The beneficiary, frequency and dollar amount for any Wire
    Transfer may be limited. The limits are designed to be flexible in order to protect the security and integrity of
    the service and accounts, including any use by you or others of the service and your Account or any other person’s
    account. Based on confidential fraud and essential risk criteria, they may be modified at our discretion without
    advance notice. We reserve the right to reject any Wire Transfer request. We have no responsibility to accept any
    incoming Wire Transfer(s) for your benefit, and we may reject any Wire Transfer request(s) for an outgoing Wire
    Transfer for reasons including, but not limited to, insufficient or uncollected funds in the account specified in
    the Wire Transfer request, a request that fails the security procedures outlined herein or if we are unable to
    verify the authenticity of the Wire Transfer request.
</li>
<p className="mb-4">If you submit a Wire Transfer request to us, we will process it on the same business day (or next
    business day if the request is not made on a business day) so long as we receive the request no later than the
    Cut-Off Time, subject to verification in accordance with the security procedures described in this Section VII. If
    it is received after the Cut-Off Time and verified through our security procedures, the Wire Transfer request may be
    processed the next business day. We may treat any Wire Transfer request received at or after our cut-off time as if
    it was received that business day, or we may treat it as if it were received at the opening of the next business
    day, in our sole and absolute discretion. If we determine, in our sole discretion, not to honor, execute, or accept
    a Wire Transfer request, we may notify you, but are not obligated to and we shall have no liability for delay or
    failure to do so. We will also use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you promptly if a Wire Transfer is
    returned to us after its execution but shall have no liability by reason of our delay or failure to do so. We shall
    have no obligation to resend a Wire Transfer if we complied with the original Wire Transfer request and such Wire
    Transfer was returned to us.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">You authorize us to debit or credit your Account immediately for an amount equal to the Wire
    Transfer request and any applicable fees related to such Wire Transfer request. Your Wire Transfer requests may
    involve the transfer of funds from your Account to another account you have with us, to an account with any other
    financial institution, or to a third party or account of a third party maintained with us or with any other
    financial institution. You shall ensure sufficient funds on deposit in the Account with us for implementation of
    each Transfer request. We will have no obligation to honor any Wire Transfer request which exceeds the balance of
    your immediately collected funds; provided, however, that you shall be liable for any amount which we elect to Wire
    Transfer in excess of such balance. You agree that we are authorized to debit the Account immediately for the Wire
    Transfer request, and you further agree that we are authorized to charge your Account a service fee for each Wire
    Transfer request you place.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">Wire Transfers to or from your Account will be governed by the rules of the funds transfer system(s)
    through which the transfers are made, including Fedwire, the National Automated Clearing House Association, the
    Electronic Check Clearing House Organization, any regional association (each an ACH), the Clearing House Interbank
    Payments System (CHIPS), the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) and the RTP
    system (“RTP System”) and UCC Article 4A. We’re under no obligation to honor, in whole or in part, any payment order
    or other instruction that could result in our contravention of applicable law, including, without limitation,
    requirements of the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the Financial
    Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”). We are under no obligation to follow any Wire Transfer request or initiate
    any Wire Transfer, nor are we obligated to follow instructions cancelling or amending any transfer request that do
    not afford us sufficient time to verify the authenticity of the instructions.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">Once we receive a Wire Transfer request, it may not be able to be cancelled or amended. However, at
    our discretion, we may use reasonable efforts to act on any request for cancellation or amendment, provided that the
    method by which we are notified of a request for cancellation or amendment complies with the Security Procedures.
    However, we shall have no liability if such cancellation or amendment is not effected. You agree to indemnify and
    hold us harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses we may incur in attempting to
    cancel or amend the Wire Transfer. Any cancellation or amendment of a Wire Transfer by us shall relieve us of any
    obligation to act on the original Wire Transfer request.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">It is your responsibility to ensure that we are provided with accurate, clear, and correct Wire
    Transfer requests and instructions, including beneficiary name and account number, in the manner and format
    prescribed by us, and that such Wire Transfer requests are given only by you. Further, you acknowledge that a
    failure to comply strictly with such procedures may delay or prevent implementation of Wire Transfer request(s) or
    result in transfers from your Account to unintended beneficiaries. You are liable for any incorrect, inaccurate or
    unclear information. If you give us the name and account number of a beneficiary, we and other financial
    institutions may process the payment order based on the account number alone, even though the number may identify a
    person other than the beneficiary named. Any errors in the information, including misidentification of
    beneficiary(ies), incorrect or inconsistent account names and numbers, identifying number of intermediary bank or
    beneficiary bank, and misspellings, are your responsibility. We will not be liable if the beneficiary’s financial
    institution does not accept the Wire Transfer or accepts the Wire Transfer and then places the funds in a suspense
    or holding account because of the discrepancy. Unless applicable law requires otherwise, we will not be liable to
    you or any other person for any losses resulting from the beneficiary’s financial institution accepting and posting
    any Wire Transfer to an incorrect account, whether based on your Wire Transfer request or for other reasons
    unrelated directly to a material breach of this Agreement by us. Incorrect, unclear or incomplete Wire Transfer
    requests may delay or prevent the processing of your Wire Transfer request or may result in transfers from your
    Account to unintended beneficiaries. If a Wire Transfer request does not designate the beneficiary’s financial
    institution, we may, in our discretion (i) accept the Wire Transfer request and make payment to any financial
    institution at which we have reason to believe the beneficiary maintains an account, or (ii) not accept the Wire
    Transfer request and seek further direction from you. In either of the foregoing situations, unless applicable law
    requires otherwise, we will not be liable for losses resulting from your failure to properly identify the financial
    institution where the beneficiary maintains an account. If a Wire Transfer request does not specify routing
    instructions, you will be deemed to have instructed us to send the wire through such correspondents as we determine
    in our sole discretion. You acknowledge that any administrative messages or comments conveyed with any Wire Transfer
    request shall be for its own internal reference and shall not be binding on us or alter the pertinent details of the
    Wire Transfer request. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, we are not required to accept Wire Transfer
    requests from you or any person acting or purporting to act on your behalf in a representative or fiduciary
    capacity, and we may refuse to accept any Wire Transfer requests in our sole and absolute discretion. We may also
    reject any incoming wire transfer. If we determine, in our sole discretion, not to honor, execute or accept a Wire
    Transfer request, we are under no obligation to inform you and shall not be liable for any failure to inform you. A
    Wire Transfer request is considered accepted by us when we execute it.
</p>
<ul classname="mb-4 list-disc">
    <li>Cut-Off Times. Wire Transfer requests for domestic and international Wire Transfers must be received and
        verified by 2:00 PM CST for domestic Wire Transfers and 11:00 AM CST for international Wire Transfers
        (collectively, the “Cut-Off Time(s)”). We may treat any transfer request received at or after our Cut-Off Time
        as if it were received that business day or we may treat it as if it were received at the opening of the next
        business day. We are not required to make a Wire Transfer on the day a transfer request is received, unless the
        properly completed transfer request is received within a reasonable time before any Cut-Off Time we have
        established. We may use any means and routes that we, in our sole discretion, consider suitable for the
        transmission of funds, and we may make use of correspondents, agents, subagents and funds transfer and
        communication systems. Such third parties shall be deemed your agents and we shall not be liable for any errors,
        delay, mis-delivery, or failure of delivery by any of them unless applicable law says otherwise. We are not
        responsible for delays or mistakes caused by other parties through whom we transmit funds.
    </li>
    <li>International and Domestic Wire Transfers. Wire Transfers may be either domestic or international, provided,
        however, international Wire Transfers may not be sent by us through or into any country in violation of U.S.
        laws. All international Wire Transfers will be routed by us through one of our correspondent financial
        institutions. Domestic Wire Transfers will settle only in U.S. Dollars, and international Wire Transfers may be
        in a foreign currency if accepted at our discretion. Such international Wire Transfer may be converted to the
        currency of the destination country at a rate of currency exchange established by correspondent financial
        institution or the beneficiary financial institution. Even if you tell us that you want the Wire Transfer sent
        in U.S. dollars, we cannot guarantee that the beneficiary institution will receive the funds in U.S. currency or
        will not convert the Wire Transfer into another currency. The actual amount that the beneficiary/designated
        recipient receives may be reduced by fees and taxes imposed by the beneficiary bank, or a correspondent bank,
        including currency conversion charges.
    </li>
    <li>Tax Payment Wire Transfer Request. Any Wire Transfer request which seeks to make payment of a tax obligation
        (the “Tax Wire Transfer”) must be submitted to us with the applicable documentation and the completed IRS
        taxpayer worksheet (where applicable) in compliance with our instructions and procedures and the terms of this
        Agreement. You acknowledge and understand that any Tax Wire Transfer may require additional time for processing
        and may require you to provide clarification and additional supporting documentation before the Tax Wire
        Transfer may be processed. You agree that you will submit any Tax Wire Transfer request in sufficient time in
        advance of your tax payment due date. We shall not be liable for any errors, delay or failure of delivery of
        your IRS payment if the Tax Wire Transfer was not submitted by you with ample time for processing of the Tax
        Wire Transfer request.
    </li>
    <li>Wire Transfers to a Beneficiary Bank. After the funds that are transferred to the beneficiary bank, the funds
        become the property of the beneficiary bank. The beneficiary bank is responsible to locate, identify, and make
        payment to your beneficiary. If your beneficiary cannot be properly identified, the funds may be returned.
    </li>
    <li>Rejected, Revoked, Cancelled or Returned Wire Transfer Requests. You acknowledge that Wire Transfer requests
        which are not made in the precise format prescribed in procedures provided to you by us may be released for
        transmission to the clearing agent, even though such transfer requests may be rejected by the clearing agent due
        to your failure to comply with format requirements or for other reasons. We cannot revoke or cancel a transfer
        request once it has been transmitted by you and we will not be liable to you if we cannot recover any funds
        already transferred. You agree that if the transfer request is returned for any reason, you will accept as
        repayment in full, the dollar amount of the transfer request, less appropriate fees.
    </li>
    <li>Delays or Non-Execution of Wire Transfer Requests. While we will handle your transfer requests as expeditiously
        as commercially reasonable, you agree that Bank will not be responsible for any delay, failure to execute, or
        mis‐execution of your Wire Transfer request due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including
        without limitation for the insolvency, neglect, misconduct, mistake, default, any inaccuracy, interruption,
        delay, or failure in the means of transmission, whether caused by strikes, power failure, equipment
        malfunctions, or acts or omissions of any bank, entity, or person whether or not that other bank, entity or
        person is our agent. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING AS TO THE FAILURE OF ANY INTERMEDIARY
        BANK OR BENEFICIARY BANK TO CREDIT YOUR BENEFICIARY WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE WIRE TRANSFER AFTER RECEIPT OF SAME
        WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER. We reserve the right to delay or not to process Wire Transfer requests if we believe
        such Wire Transfer (a) relates to any internet gambling transactions or any illegal transactions; (b) relates to
        one or more beneficiaries listed on the Specially Designated National lists from the U.S. Department of
        Treasury; or (c) may violate any Executive Order of the President, Foreign Governmental Embargoes/Sanctions,
        directive of the U.S. Department of the Treasury or law.
    </li>
    <li>We may disclose any information given to us that we, in our sole discretion, determine is necessary or desirable
        to disclose; except we will only disclose confidential information if required by law, a court, or legal,
        regulatory, or governmental authority, or as permitted by law in order to combat, prevent, or investigate issues
        arising under anti-money laundering laws, economic sanctions, or criminal law. Sometimes legal, regulatory, or
        governmental authorities require additional information, either in respect of individuals, entities, or
        particular transactions. You agree to promptly supply all such information, which any such authority may
        require, and/or which we may be required to supply, in relation to the individual, entity, or particular
        transaction. If you, or your authorized representative, breach any such laws or regulations, you irrevocably
        agree that we may retain any monies or funds transmitted to us pursuant to this Agreement and/or not fulfill any
        Wire Transfer request if we are required to take or refrain from such action by any legal, regulatory, or
        governmental authority or if we reasonably believe that such action may violate any laws or regulations
        described herein, and such monies shall not bear interest against us. You further agree that we may pay such
        monies to the appropriate legal, regulatory, or governmental authority, if and when required by law.
    </li>
    <li>If we receive an incoming international wire transfer for payment into your Account that was remitted in a
        currency other than U.S. dollars, we will convert the amount of the payment into U.S. dollars using the
        applicable exchange rate for credit to your Account. The exchange rates we use for your transactions are not
        necessarily the bank-to-bank negotiated exchange rate or other potentially more favorable rate. You consent to
        our doing this without prior notice to you. FDIC deposit insurance does not insure against any loss due to
        foreign currency fluctuations. If for any reason we do not receive covering payment from the remitting or
        intermediary bank in respect of an incoming international Wire Transfer we have credited to your Account, you
        agree to allow us to debit your Account for the amount credited under such incoming international Wire Transfer.
        Wire Transfers sent to foreign countries may be converted to the currency of the destination country at our rate
        of currency exchange for remittance transfers. We cannot guarantee that the beneficiary/designated recipient
        will receive the funds in U.S. currency. The actual amount that the beneficiary/designated recipient receives
        may be reduced by fees and taxes imposed by the beneficiary bank, or a correspondent bank, including currency
        conversion charges.
    </li>
</ul>
<p className="mb-4">VIII. DEPOSIT AVAILABILITY.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">When a deposit is made to your Account, the funds may not be available immediately. This Section
    VIII (Deposit Availability Disclosure) describes when funds will be made available to you.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">A. Delays. We may delay the availability of funds from certain types of deposits to your Account.
    There are exceptions that may apply in certain circumstances (e.g., if you have overdrawn your Account repeatedly in
    the last six months or there is an emergency). During the delay, you may not withdraw funds and may not use the
    funds. We will notify you if we delay the availability of your funds if required by law, and we will tell you when
    you can expect your funds to be available if required by law.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">B. Deposits. Any transaction that you conduct on Saturday, Sunday, a federal holiday, or other days
    on which we are closed will be handled the following business day. If we receive a deposit before 4:00 PM MT on a
    business day, we will consider that business day to be the day of your deposit. However, if we receive a deposit
    after 4:00 PM MT or on a non -business day, we will consider the deposit as having been made the next business day.
    Deposits may only be made by EFT, which includes direct deposits and ATM Transfers.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">C. Special Rules for New Accounts. If you are a new customer, the following special rules will appl
    during the first 30 days your account is open. Funds from electronic direct deposits to your Account will be
    available on the day we receive the deposit. Funds from deposits of cash, wire transfers, and, if made available,
    the first $5,000 of a day's total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveler's, and federal, state and
    local government checks will be available on the same business day we receive your deposit if the deposit meets
    certain conditions. For example, the checks must be payable to you (and you may have to use a special deposit slip).
    The excess over $5,000 will be available on the ninth business day after the day of your deposit. If your deposit of
    these checks (other than a U.S. Treasury check) is not made in person to one of our associates, the first $5,000 may
    not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. Funds from all other check deposits
    may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">D. Availability of ACH Transfer and EFT Deposits. Funds from ACH Transfers or EFTs that you initiate
    through another bank will generally be available on the next business day after the day the ACH Transfer or EFT is
    deemed to be received by us. An ACH Transfer or EFT debit to a Linked Account or any other external account that we
    originate on your behalf will generally be made available on the third business day after the date the ACH Transfer
    or EFT is deemed to be received and processed by us. Once they are available, you can us e the funds for EFTs and
    ACH Transfers. Even after we have made funds available to you and you have withdrawn the funds, you remain
    responsible if any deposit to your Account is returned, rejected, or otherwise uncollected by the Bank. </p>
